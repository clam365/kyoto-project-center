            <p className={"text-sm"}>
                For future students, policy makers, researchers, community leaders, and investors, we have
                outlined a series of future recommendations aimed at fostering balanced development and
                sustainable progress in the neighborhood. Emphasis is placed on the continuation of current
                business marketing strategies to enhance Kikuhama’s appeal to residents and tourists alike.
                Additionally, strategies for optimizing unutilized spaces are proposed to maximize community
                benefit. Finally, suggestions for future WPI students are provided to ensure success in their
                projects, allowing continuous improvement and adaptability to address the growing challenges

                        Kikuhama’s appeal lies in its natural beauty, especially the Kamo River
                        and Takase Canal, which businesses like Kawama Cafe and Smile Chocolate
                        Cafe leverage for strategic marketing. As the area grows, it is crucial
                        to preserve these features, ensuring urban development complements the
                        community’s character and fosters balanced growth through collaboration
                        with local businesses.

                        Repurposing abandoned buildings into affordable housing or mixed-use
                        developments can help maintain this balance, fostering long-term sustainability
                        and a vibrant community for both locals and tourists.

                        repurposed into community areas like gardens or markets, fostering a stronger
                        sense of community and adding dynamic features while preserving the

                        Future WPI students working on projects in Kikuhama should prioritize engaging

                        and development through maps and previous studies. Mastering tools like QGIS during

                        students to make thoughtful, impactful recommendations that benefit both the
