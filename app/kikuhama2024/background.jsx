                Kikuhama, in eastern Kyoto, is bordered by the Kamo River, Karawaramachi-dori,
                Gojo-dori, and Shichijo-dori. Once a thriving entertainment district during the
                Edo and Taisho periods, it was known for nightlife, arts, and geisha culture 
                but declined after the 1958 Anti-Prostitution Law and failed rebranding efforts.
                In recent years, Kikuhama&#39;s proximity to the Kamo River and Takase Canal has
                renewed interest, driven by Kyoto&#39;s growing tourism. However, the area faces challenges
                from an aging population, the outmigration of younger residents, and the conversion 
                of traditional homes into tourist accommodations.

                The rise of guest accommodations, including hotels and Airbnbs, has reshaped Kikuhama,
                driving gentrification and escalating housing costs. Between 2015 and 2019, housing prices
                surged, making homeownership unaffordable for many residents. This transformation has also
                impacted local traffic and the neighborhood’s layout, with increased tourism contributing
                to congestion and altering the flow of daily life. As traditional homes are converted into
                tourist rentals, the area’s community fabric weakens, leaving fewer spaces for locals.
                Balancing tourism growth with preserving the district’s identity and livability remains a
                significant challenge for Kikuhama’s future development.
