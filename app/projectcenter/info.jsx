                        <h1>Kyoto, the &#34;heart of Japan,&#34; offers a unique blend of traditional culture and
                            modern innovation, making it the perfect location for WPI students to engage in
                            impactful projects. Since 2018, students have worked on projects ranging from
                            augmented reality tourism to sustainable farming, urban revitalization, and
                            international education programs. Students will enjoy access to kitchen facilities
                            to explore Japanese cuisine, which traditionally features rice and noodles but now
                            includes diverse options like yakiniku and hamburgers. With Kyoto&#39;s efficient
                            public transportation and bike rental options, getting around the city is easy,
                            while some projects may require overnight travel, covered by the program fee.
                            The city’s humid subtropical climate, with September temperatures ranging from 71°F
                            to 85°F and cooler, rainy December weather, adds to the immersive experience.</h1>
