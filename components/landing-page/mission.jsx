                    Since 2019, WPI students have conducted meaningful projects to address
                    challenges in the city of Kyoto through a blend of cultural understanding
                    and technological innovation. These projects span a wide range of topics,
                    from urban revitalization and sustainable farming practices to augmented
                    reality tourism and environmental education. Many of these initiatives
                    have supported Kyotoâ€™s efforts to balance tradition with modern development.
